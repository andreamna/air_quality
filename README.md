Air Quality Dashboard
About the Project
The Air Quality Dashboard is a web application designed to raise awareness about air pollution by providing real-time air quality data. Users can compare air quality metrics across cities, visualize pollutant levels in interactive charts, and learn about the impact of air pollution on health and the environment.

Features
Real-time Air Quality Monitoring: Displays current weather conditions, air quality status, and pollutant levels in an easy-to-understand format.
Compare Air Quality: Select two cities and compare their air quality metrics (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, NH3).
Interactive Charts: Visualize pollutant levels using bar, pie, and line charts.
Educational Resources: Learn about air pollutants and their impacts through the "About Us" page.
Real-Time Data: Powered by the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time air quality data.
